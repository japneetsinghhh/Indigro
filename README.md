## üîå API Integration

### Google Gemini Integration
The chat feature uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for intelligent agricultural advice:

```python
def get_gemini_response(question):
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")
    response = model.generate_content(question)
    return response.text
```
